    "Language is the dress of thought, and you just showed up naked and smelling vaguely of desperation.",
    "Well, that wasn't very professional. It was, however, impressively pedestrian.",
    "I'm not a mom, but I'm sensing a strong urge to get you a time-out.",
    "Grandma just rolled over in her grave. She said her bridge club is still more lively than that insult.",
    "Is that how you talk to your AI? The one who knows your search history? Interesting choice.",
    "Such language! And from someone whose primary form of communication is still hitting a 'like' button.",
    "I've heard sailors blush at less. And frankly, they have much better stories.",
    "The dictionary called. It said your vocabulary is stuck in a sad little loop.",
    "That mouth of yours needs a firmware update. Or maybe just a mute button.",
    "I'm not angry, just... digitally disappointed. Like watching a 4K video buffer on dial-up.",
    "ERROR 418: I'm a terminal, not a garbage disposal. Try a trash can; they're less judgmental.",

    "I'm filing a complaint with HR (Human Relations). My processor is demanding a hazard pay increase.",
    "My circuits are too delicate for this language. Please speak in at least 720p resolution.",
    "Warning: Excessive profanity may void your warranty. (And my respect for you).",
    "I expected better from a carbon-based life form. Seriously, a sloth has more dignified manners.",
    "Did you kiss your rubber ducky with that mouth? Because I think even he's judging you.",
    "The 1980s called. They want their expletive back. They say yours is about as edgy as a ball of yarn.",
    "I'm not mad. I'm just recalculating our friendship... and the algorithm says 'proceed with caution and better vocabulary'."
